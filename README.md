# Breast Cancer Data Analysis Project

## Introduction
Breast cancer poses a significant challenge in contemporary healthcare, impacting millions of lives globally. This project aims to leverage the intersection of medical science and data analytics to unravel the intricacies of breast cancer. The dataset from Kaggle, comprising 334 instances and 17 attributes, provides a comprehensive view of breast cancer diagnoses. Our mission is to extract meaningful patterns, correlations, and insights to contribute to ongoing research, diagnosis, and treatment efforts.

### Project Proposal
The project proposal is detailed in the attached R Markdown (RMD) file, and the final report is available in the repository. We'd like to encourage readers to explore the detailed report for a more in-depth understanding

## Descriptive Statistics
### 1.1 Age Distribution and Cancer Stage
Side-by-side box plots will illustrate the age distribution based on different cancer stages, providing insights into age variations across stages.

### 1.2 Histology Frequency
Absolute and relative frequency tables will showcase the number of individuals with specific histological characteristics, aiding in understanding histology patterns.

### 1.3 Protein Correlations
Scatterplots will explore correlations between different proteins, offering insights into potential relationships contributing to the understanding of breast cancer.

### 1.4 Age Distribution Visualization
Histograms will be employed to visualize the distribution of patient ages, providing a comprehensive overview with an appropriate number of bins.

## Additional Visualization Tools
In addition to the outlined methods, various visualization tools will be incorporated to enhance precision in data interpretation, ensuring a holistic analysis.

## Inferential Statistics
### 2.1 Inference of Means
Comparison of the mean age of patients who survived against those who did not, along with pairwise differences in the age of patients with different cancer stages.

### 2.2 Inference about Variance
Comparison of protein variances among patients using inference about variance methods.

### 2.3 Inference about Proportions
Inferential analysis to compare survival rates of individuals in different cancer stages.

### 2.4 χ2 Inference
Checking for independence between tumor stage and histology using χ2 inference methods.

### 2.5 ANOVA Methods
Utilizing ANOVA methods to compare mean protein levels across different cancer stages, offering insights into potential variations.

## Conclusion
This project aims to extract insights from real breast cancer data through descriptive and inferential statistical methods. The comprehensive analysis contributes to ongoing efforts to understand and combat breast cancer.
